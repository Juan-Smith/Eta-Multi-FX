## Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify">One of the main parts of playing the guitar is the ability to mix and match different effect together in order to achieve your own unique sound. One way of  generating these different effects in order to alter one's guitar sound is through the use of a Multi-Effects Unit. These units provide a vast amount of different effects in a single package that allows you to mix and match to your heart's content. The main drawback however to these multi effects units is that their price is not within lots of guitar player's budgets. The Eta Multi-FX unit aims to address this problem by providing guitar players with a cheaper alternative.</div>
